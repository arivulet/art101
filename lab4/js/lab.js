// Print an empty 6-row by 7-column grid with empty values
// Decide which player goes first.
// Show the current grid to players after every move.
// Prompt current player to choose a column (0 to 6).
// If the chosen column is full:
// Print "Column full, choose another.”

// If the chosen column is NOT full:
// place the player's token in the lowest available row in that column.
// After each move, check for 4 matching tokens:
