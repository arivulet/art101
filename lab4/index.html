					<h2>Task 3 - JS Pseudocode</h2>
					<pre><code>
//Four in a Row

// Setting up
  // Assign Player 1 with Red, And Player 2 with Yellow
  // Print an empty 6-row by 7-column grid with empty values
// Decide which player goes first.
// Show the current grid to players after every move.
// Prompt current player to choose a column (0 to 6).
  // If the chosen column is full:
	// Print "Column full, choose another.”
	// Update the board
  // If the chosen column is NOT full:
	// place the player's token in the lowest available row in that column.
// After each move, check for 4 matching tokens:
  // Horizontally
  // Vertically
  // Diagonally (both directions)
  // If the board does not have 4 matching tokens, continue to the next step.
// Check for a Tie
// If the board is not full, continue to the next step.
// If the board is full and there is no winner, declare a tie.
// Switch Turns
// Change to the other player.
// Repeat steps 2-7 until there is a winner.
// End the Game
  // If there’s a winner, display the winner and end the game.
  // If it’s a tie, display a tie message.
// Offer option to restart or exit.
